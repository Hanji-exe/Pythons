# Simple Calculator Program (Python)

---

## Project Overview
This project is a **Simple Calculator** built using **Python** that performs basic arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.  
It serves as an introductory project to strengthen programming logic, input handling, and function design — ideal for **beginners learning Python**.

---
 
## Features
Perform the four basic math operations:  
- Addition (`+`)  
- Subtraction (`-`)  
- Multiplication (`*`)  
- Division (`/`)  

User-friendly and interactive console-based interface  
Error handling for invalid inputs (like dividing by zero or entering non-numeric values)

##  How It Works
1. The program displays a menu with arithmetic operations.  
2. The user selects an operation by entering its corresponding symbol.  
3. The program asks for two numbers.  
4. It performs the calculation and prints the result.  
5. The process repeats until the user chooses to exit.
