# Python Syntax 

---

## Project Description
This beginner-friendly project lets you explore and apply the fundamentals of Python syntax.  
It includes variables, identifiers, indentation, input/output, multi-line statements, comments, docstrings, and string formatting.  
You’ll build an interactive program that demonstrates all these concepts together — perfect for solidifying your understanding of Python basics.

## Project Required Output
- When executed, the program should:
- Ask for your name and age
- Compare the age with 18 and print the condition
- Display the data type of each input
- Calculate and print the area of a square
- Demonstrate string formatting methods (format, f-string, %)
- Include a short delay using time.sleep()
- Print a final summary
